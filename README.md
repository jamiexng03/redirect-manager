# redirect-manager

### Background

Web pages get removed and URLs get changed for many reasons. In an e-commerce store such as Promega.com, products are marked as discontinued, therefore their associated product details page online should be deleted. However, if a product page is simply just deleted, then customers/users will run into user experience issues (such as running into a 404 error page) and search engine optimization (SEO) issues. Therefore, a 301 redirect is needed to stop any visits to that page, reaching a dead end on the site. A 301 redirect is basically a permanent redirect that takes users (and search engines) to a new URL when the original page no longer exists. Even if the product itself has been discontinued, perhaps their product details page still holds SEO value, a 301 redirect is put into to ensure customers are being directed to another relevant product page.
